# Project Overview

Welcome to project WatchLink! This repository contains two main directories. Each directory has its own `README.md` file with specific details and instructions.


## Getting Started

To get started with the project:
1. Explore the **button_design_files/** directory if you are interested in the hardware design and development of a WatchLink sensor.
2. Explore the **pdf_parser/** directory if you are interested in running the software tools for parsing ECG data out of Apple Health or Fitbit exported PDFs.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please open an issue or create a pull request.

abstract = {We introduce a low-power communication method that lets smartwatches leverage existing electrocardiogram (ECG) hardware as a data communication interface. Our unique approach enables the connection of external, inexpensive, and low-power "add-on" sensors to the smartwatch, expanding its functionalities. These sensors cater to specialized user needs beyond those offered by pre-built sensor suites, at a fraction of the cost and power of traditional communication protocols, including Bluetooth Low Energy. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we conduct a series of exploratory and evaluative tests to characterize the ECG interface as a communication channel on commercial smartwatches. We design a simple transmission scheme using commodity components, demonstrating cost and power benefits. Further, we build and test a suite of add-on sensors, including UV light, body temperature, buttons, and breath alcohol, all of which achieved testing objectives at low material cost and power usage. This research paves the way for personalized and user-centric wearables by offering a cost-effective solution to expand their functionalities.},
