# Hardware Design Files for WatchLink Buttons Sensor

This repository contains the hardware design files for the button circuit project, including schematic, PCB layout, BOM, 3D render, and Gerber files. These files are intended for use with PCB design, fabrication and assembly. Feel free to update the files for use with a different sensor.

## File Descriptions

- **3D Render.png**: A 3D visualization of the PCB design, showing how the final assembled board will look.
- **BOM.csv**: The Bill of Materials for the project, listing all components required for the PCB, including part numbers and quantities.
- **Buttons-Sch-EasyEDA.json**: The schematic file in EasyEDA format, suitable for users who prefer to use EasyEDA for editing or reviewing the circuit.
- **Buttons-Sch-Altium.schdoc**: The schematic file in Altium Designer format, for users who use Altium for PCB design.
- **Gerber Files.zip**: The Gerber files for the PCB, necessary for PCB fabrication. These files are compatible with most PCB manufacturers.
- **PCB.pdf**: A PDF version of the PCB layout for quick viewing and review without needing specialized PCB software.
- **Schematic.pdf**: A PDF version of the circuit schematic for easy reference and sharing.
